Roll Marker
===============
Unreal Engine 5.2.1
===============
Gameplay: player controls the character-marker (ball), the game goal is to paint all targets on the level in your color.
Coloring of the target occurs when the player collides with the target. Spotted targets when colliding with clean targets are also painted in the player's color.
There are also "cleaners" on the stage - these are targets that can return spotted targets to their original state.
Targets move randomly around the stage, which adds complexity to the gameplay.
The game ends when all targets, including the cleaners, have been painted in the player's color.
